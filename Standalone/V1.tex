\section{The Problem}
2019 Dodge Charger Scatpack 6.4L HEMI - It has 4 main computers that are required for the engine to begin to run in its stock configuration.

\begin{itemize}
    \item RFHub
    \item PCM
    \item BCM
    \item TCM
\end{itemize}
These computers can be a headache for those who want to attempt engine swaps or simple engine tuning, we often hear older non-technical people in the car world mention that back in their day it wasn't so complicated to get things running.
\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
These four computers must be from the same vehicle or they must have the same VIN programming in order for them to work and it should \textbf{never} work this way!
\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
Ideally an individual should be able to have one simple ECU to run their engine with an appropriate set of performance features without paying thousands of dollars.

\section{The Target Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Display Screen(?)
    \item Real Time Data Logging(Wireless?)
    \item Modern tuning interface
    \item Wheelie control
    \item Real Time Speed Density Based Tuning
    \item Extremely custom engine protection
    \item Custom Warnings
    \item Launch Control
    \item Traction Control
    \item AI Apprentice(?)
    \item Race Application Sensor Support
    \item 8 x Ignition Outputs
    \item 8 x Fuel Injection Outputs
    \item Drive By Wire (DBW) Throttle Control
    \item Anti-Lag
    \item Tune by gear
    \item Multi-fuel Support- Support for Petrol (Gasoline), Methanol and Ethanol
    
\end{itemize}

\section{AI Apprentice}
Create multiple categories of surface+weather types and use your revisions along with data from the logs to train your apprentice who will eventually get just as good as you at finding a near perfect tune for the surface+weather combo in question.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
I think this feature will be game changing for racers who would prefer to use their previous tuning sessions to automatically optimize their car for the surface in question. One test pull and your apprentice should be able to dial your car in for the next run. This is ideal for no prep racers.

\section{No CAN or OBD2 compliance}
There will be no CAN system on board or any clearable DTCs due to the purpose of this system. There will be clearable warnings and Errors.
